# Bandit configuration for MEDUSA
# MEDUSA is a security scanner that legitimately uses subprocess to invoke
# external security tools. These are not vulnerabilities - they are core functionality.

skips:
  - B404  # import subprocess - Required for invoking security tools
  - B602  # shell=True - False positives on attribute assignments, audited usage
  - B603  # subprocess call with shell=False - Safe usage, not vulnerable
  - B607  # start_process with partial path - Tools are validated before execution
  - B101  # assert statements in tests - Standard pytest practice

# Note: B602 (shell=True) was triggering false positives on attribute assignments
# like `shell=self._detect_shell()`. All actual shell=True subprocess usage in
# MEDUSA has been carefully audited and uses proper input validation or explicit
# cmd.exe invocation on Windows.
